# HitBall
Modern Pingball made with opengl and c++

The game is inspired by Breakout, a classic 2D game released in 1976 on the Atari 2600 console. 

The game has the following mechanics:

    • A small paddle is controlled by the player and can only move horizontally within the bounds
    of the screen.

    • The ball travels across the screen and each collision results in the ball changing its direction
    based on where it hit; this applies to the screen bounds, the bricks, and the paddle.

    • If the ball reaches the bottom edge of the screen, the player is either game over or loses a life.

    • As soon as a brick touches the ball, the brick is destroyed.

    • The player wins as soon as all bricks are destroyed.

    • The direction of the ball can be manipulated by how far the ball bounces from the paddle’s
    center

Apart from these, the game also includes:

    • Particles

    • Text rendering

    • Postprocessing effects

    • Multiple (customizable) levels
